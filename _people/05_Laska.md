Laska is the proud mascot of **bullab** and a [Markiesje](https://www.markiesjeusa.org/markiesje-history) by breed â€” our very own Dutch Tulip Hound: elegance wrapped in a small, fast-moving black blur full of charm.

### ðŸŒ· About the Markiesje (Dutch Tulip Hound)
The Markiesje is a rare and elegant companion breed from the Netherlands, known for its silky black coat, feathered ears, and affectionate nature. Though its origins trace back to the 17th century, the breed was resuscitated in the 1970s and officially recognized by the Dutch Kennel Club in 1999 .

These dogs are intelligent, cheerful, and thrive on companionship.
